# Additional Info:
This program uses the Google Youtube API v3. You need to load your own authorization client_secrets.json since this isnt really a public program but rather an private project. Please note the YouTube API v3 has a "Quota" limit. You get 10000 quotas a day. An upload costs 1600 quotas.
