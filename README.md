# Additional Info:
This program uses the Google Youtube API v3. You need to load your own authorization client_secrets.json since this isnt really a public program but rather an private project. Please note the YouTube API v3 has a "Quota" limit. You get 10000 quotas a day. An upload costs 1600 quotas. We cant really change that without buying extra quoatas or asking Google for more. If you really want to bulk upload a lot of videos, you need to create A LOT of new Google Accounts and setup a new client_secrets.json then you need to modify this program so it loads all client_secrets.json you just made and use every client_secrets.json only 6 times before switching to the next. BUT since this probably isnt legal and you will get banned from the Google API I wont code this part.
